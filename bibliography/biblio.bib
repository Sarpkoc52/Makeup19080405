   abstract = {Only 7 percent of the female population in our country are licensed sportswomen. Among these, the rate of sportswomen active in sports is only 4 percent. There are only  six  sports  branches  in  which  the  number  of  licensed  sportswomen  is  more than the number of sportsmen: horse-riding, ice skating, gymnastics, dance sports, folk  dances  and  volleyball.  The  number  of  sportswomen  should  be  increased  in sports federations. The number of licensed male football players registered to the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) is 602.465. On the other hand, the number of licensed female football players registered to the TFF is only 6.364. That is, there is  1  licensed  female  football  player  in  return  for  100  licensed  male  football players. One-fifth of licensed female sportswomen in Turkey prefers martial arts such as Judo, Karate, Boxing, Kick Boxing, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, and Wushu. In order to ensure the development of female sports in our country, firstly, sports culture needs to be spread to the society. To beable to achieve this, it is necessary to make sport an indispensable part of basic education and to emphasize that sport is  a  fundamental  right  of  each  citizen.  Most  importantly,  all  kinds  of  sports activities,  organizations,  and  investments  organized  formen  should  also  be realized for women},

   abstract = {[Sport is a very prominent social institution in almost every society because it combines the characteristics found in any institution with a unique appeal only duplicated by, perhaps, religion. The functional, conflict, and cultural studies perspectives are reviewed, with additional discussion on how sport relates to the processes of socialization and social change. The latter focusses on the evolution of sport from a playful, participation-oriented activity to one that resembles a corporate form guided by the principles of commercialism and entertainment. The role of sport in international relations and national development dramatizes the political meaning of sport to many societies. While sport may be integrative at the higher political levels, it has not been so at the interpersonal levels of gender and race. The inequality that characterizes society's relations of gender and race is found in sport as well. The sociology of sport will be able to shed more light on all of these issues when theory informs more of the research in this subfield.]},

   abstract = {<p>With the continuous development of human society, the sense of equality is getting stronger and stronger, and feminism is also on the rise. This makes competitive sports, which was the exclusive right of men in the early days, open to women as a symbol of gender equality. In the last decade of the 20th century, gender equality in sports attracted the attention of the International Olympic Committee and other sports-related organizations. Since ancient times, female sports workers have been treated unfairly in the field of sports. How to solve the problem of gender equality in sports is a continuous concern in the research. Through the analysis of female work in the sports field: female athletes, female referees and female journalists, this paper finds that women are at a disadvantage in competitive sports, sports news, commentary and other related industries. Compared with other fields, the absolute position of men in sports is more difficult to shake. Although the number of women engaged in sports-related industries and the types involved are gradually increasing in recent years, this is only a representation, and there are still obvious disadvantages compared with men. The public's deep-rooted prejudice and potential sexist ideas about women engaging in sports-related industries are the most fundamental problems, which not only lead to the public's disapproval of women engaging in sports-related industries, but also have a negative impact on how women view themselves. After a series of analyses, it is found that female sports workers are still marginalized.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The problem of clarifying the content of social roles in conditions of high dynamics of the transformation of society necessarily raises the question of revising the content of gender differences as a set of social indicators of gender. A particularly controversial problem field in the context of gender relations is sports, which is an important institution of socialization and an instrument of social success. The masculine nature of sports activity leaves an imprint on their social status in the context of gender guidelines and raises questions about the gender status of sports and the problems of gender identity of athletes. The aim of the article is to study the gender factor in sports and to study the gender orientation of the values of sports as a social institution. The methodology of the study is determined by its problem field. When considering subjectobject relations in the system of gender identification, the methods of a dialectical approach were applied, where gender was studied as a unity of subjective-personal and objective-cultural factors of thinking and behavior. When considering the problem of masculinization of female athletes, a structural approach was employed, where gender is considered as a cultural and historical code, as a special case of an episteme in gender-role discourse. In the study of the initial masculinity of sports values, a biosocial approach was used, where the phenomenon of sports was considered from both biological and social positions. The development of the problem of gender factor research in sports included consideration of the following issues: masculinity of sports as their typical feature, the impossibility of their feminization; the problem of masculinization of female athletes; sport as an area of female emancipation. As a result, the historical and physiological reasons for the masculinity of sports are considered. The archaic criteria for assessing gender identity and the inclusion of gender-specific personality traits characteristic of modern people in masculinity indicators are substantiated. The role of sports in the phenomenon of women’s emancipation is considered: the role of infrastructural and cultural factors of women’s inclusion in sports. The ambiguity of the phenomenon of masculinization of female athletes, the symbolic nature of the criteria, and the formulation of this problem are revealed. The role of the historical development of sports in the direction of universal needs and opportunities is shown, where the differentiation of sports disciplines and its qualitative diversity play a special role. This evolution has ensured an equal participation of women and men in sports activities.</p>},
